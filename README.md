The file newton.py will return the M_Newton sparse matrix. The number of buses, continguencies, and processors must be specified in order to run the file. An example of a command to run the file is shown below:

python3 newton.py 2224 6 6

This will product the M_Newton matrix for 2224 buses and 6 contigencies, using 6 processors.
